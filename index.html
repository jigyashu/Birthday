          <h2>From my heart ❤️</h2>

          <p>Some memories don’t need photos, but they’re still some of the happiest moments of my life 🎞️💖.  
          Like when you stayed over during exams — those three days meant so much to me. Waking up and seeing you there, even in the middle of all the stress, just felt perfect 🌅.  
          
          We’ve had our little fights too 😅, but they never lasted, because being upset with you was never worth it.  
          
          On my birthday 🎂, when you came out with me and I got to hold your hand — honestly, that was one of the happiest moments I’ve ever had. And today, on your birthday, I want you to know how special you are to me 🥰🎉.  
          I would also love to explore a the world 🌎 together if you would like to join me.
            
          There are so many other little moments we don’t have pictures for, because I was too dumb to ask 😅… but not anymore! I promise to capture and cherish all the silly, happy, and unforgettable memories with you from now on 💕.  
          
          Thank you for being you — real, kind, strong, and someone I can’t imagine my life without and once again Happy Birthday, Apurva! 🎉💖🥰.  
          And before this ends… there’s one last thing I’ve wanted to say for a long time ❤️.</p>
